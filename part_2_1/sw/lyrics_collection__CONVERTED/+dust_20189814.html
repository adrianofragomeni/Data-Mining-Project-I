<body>If dust could only talk<br>What would we hear it say?<br>Before it's brushed aside<br>Just as it's swept away<br><br>It's just the evidence<br>It's of no consequence<br>It's only flesh and bone<br>Why don't you leave it alone?<br><br>If dust could only gather into lines of chalk<br>Around a silhouette detective fiction walks<br>For it's the only witness that can testify<br>Can I spit out the truth<br>Or would you rather just swallow a lie?<br><br>Why did they dam the land?<br>How did they flood the plain?<br>Did they erase the name?<br>And wipe away the stain<br>You kept your mouth well shut<br>Appeared to turn your coat<br>Now there's a name for you but it's stuck in my throat<br><br>If dust could only mutter<br>Or in laughter trill<br>If it could warn and whisper from the windowsill<br>For it's the only witness that can testify<br>Can I spit out the truth?<br>Or would you rather just swallow a lie?<br><br>Here comes the juggernaut<br>Here come The Poisoners<br>They choke the life and land<br>And rob the joy from us<br>Why do they taste of sugar<br>When they are made of money<br>Here come the Lamb of God<br>And the butcher's boy, Sonny<br><br>If dust could only gather in a needle track<br>Then it would skip a beat and it would jump right back<br>If dust could only gather in a needle track<br>Then it would skip a beat<br>And all the sense I lack
