<body>I get in from work at 2a.m.<br>And sit down with a beer<br>Turn on the late night t.v.<br>And then wonder why I'm here<br>It's meaningless and trivial<br>And it washes over me<br>And once again I wonder<br>Is this all there is for me<br><br>Here I am again<br>Look at me again<br>Here I am again<br>On my own<br>Trying hard to see<br>What there is for me<br>Here I am again<br>On my own<br><br>Life seems so pathetic<br>I wish I could live it all behind<br>This canvas chair, this bed,<br>These walls that fall in on my mind<br>Hold on for something better<br>That just drags you trough the dirt<br>Do you just let go or carry on<br>And try to take the hurt
