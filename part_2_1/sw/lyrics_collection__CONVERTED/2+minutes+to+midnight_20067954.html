<body>Kill for gain or shoot to maim<br>But we don't need a reason<br>The Golden Goose is on the loose<br>And never out of season<br>Some blackened pride still burns inside<br>This shell of bloody treason<br>Here's my gun for a barrel of fun<br>For the love of living death.<br><br>[Chorus]<br>The killer's breed or the demon's seed, <br>The glamour, the fortune, the pain, <br>Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain, <br>But don't you pray for my soul anymore.<br>Two minutes to midnight<br>The hands that threaten doom.<br>Two minutes to midnight<br>To kill the unborn in the womb.<br><br>The blind men shout let the creatures out<br>We'll show the unbelievers<br>The napalm screams of human flames<br>Of a prime time Belsen feast, yeah! <br>As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy, <br>We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies.<br><br>[Chorus]<br><br>The body bags and little rags of children torn in two<br>And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you.<br>As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song, <br>To the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gun.<br><br>[Chorus]<br><br>Midnight, all night
