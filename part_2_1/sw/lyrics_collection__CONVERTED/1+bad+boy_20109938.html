<body>What you heard about me<br>Was probably right<br>I'm the boy next door<br>The one you were warned about<br>Oh yes, indeed<br><br>Well, I'm no upstanding citizen<br>but I'm standing up just the same<br><br>[Chorus]<br>Number one bad boy<br>who's to blame<br>Number one bad boy<br>Ain't that a shame<br>Yeah, right<br><br>All my friends are two faced<br>And I'm a social disgrace<br>I got no morals<br>Don't belong in the rat race<br><br>Well, I'm no upstanding citizen<br>but I'm standing up just the same<br><br>Into a lonely world<br>Where I'm lost without a trace<br>Two faced<br>rat race<br>disgrace<br><br>Will I stand up on my own?<br>Will I fall on my face?<br><br>[Chorus]
