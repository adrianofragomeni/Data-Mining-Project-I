<body>I'm going out sleepwalking<br>Where mute memories start talking<br>The boss that couldn't help but hurt you<br>And the pretty thing he made desert you<br><br>I'm going out now like a baby<br>A name unsatisfiable baby<br>Grabbing onto whatever's around<br>For the soaring high or the crushing down<br><br>With hidden cracks that don't show<br>But that constantly just grow<br>I'm looking for the man that attacked me<br>While everybody was laughing at me<br><br>You beat it in me that part of you<br>But I'm gonna split us back in two<br>Tired of living in a cloud<br>If you're gonna say shit now you'll do it out loud<br><br>It's 2:45 in the morning<br>And I'm putting myself on warning<br>For waking up in an unknown place<br>With a recollection you've half erased<br><br>Looking for somebody's arms to<br>Wave away past harms<br>I'm walking out on center circle<br>The both of you can just fade to black<br><br>I'm walking out on center circle<br>Been pushed away and I'll never go back
</body>
