<body>One by one, they followed the sun,<br>One by one, until there were none.<br>Two by two, to their lovers they flew,<br>Two by two, into the foggy dew.<br>Three by three, they danced on the sea,<br>Four by four, they danced on the shore,<br>Five by five, they tried to survive,<br>Six by six, they were playing with tricks.<br><br>How many paths did they try and fail?<br>How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?<br>How much poison did they inhale?<br>How many black cats crossed their trail?<br>Seven by seven, they headed for heaven,<br>Eight by eight, they got to the gate,<br>Nine by nine, they drank the wine,<br>Ten by ten, they drank again.<br><br>How many tomorrow's have are they given away?<br>How many compared to yesterday?<br>How many more without any reward?<br>How many more can they afford?<br>Two by two, they stepped into the ark,<br>Two by two, they step in the dark.<br>Three by three, they're turning the key,<br>Four by four, they turn it some more,<br>One by one, they follow the sun,<br>Two by two, to another rendezvous.
