<title>...And Through The Wire</title>
</head>
<body>And through the wire I hear your voice<br>And through the wire I touch the power<br>And through the wire I see your face<br>It's through the wire<br><br>Friday night, you're staying at home I want you<br>I'm tickling and clicking a metronome I want you<br>Prowling the waterhole-I wait for the kill I want you<br>Pressure's building-overspill I want you<br><br>And through the wire You are secure<br>And through the wire We can talk<br>And through the wire We can walk<br>It's through the wire<br><br>Watchmaker steadies his delicate hand I want you<br>For barbecue parties on blood red sands I want you<br>Caught in the struggle tight on the rod I want you<br>Bring out the devil to bring out the god I want you<br><br>And through the wire I hear your voice<br>And through the wire I touch the power<br>And through the wire I see your face<br>It's through the wire<br><br>Driving 'round the city rings<br>Staring at the shape of things<br>I talk in pictures not in words<br>Overloaded with everything we said<br>be careful where you tread<br>Watch the wire<br><br>And through the wire You are secure<br>And through the wire We can talk<br>And through the wire We can walk<br>And through the wire We're clinging like leeches<br>And through the wire We push out tailor-made speeches<br>And through the wire We get so strange across the border<br>We get so strange across the border
