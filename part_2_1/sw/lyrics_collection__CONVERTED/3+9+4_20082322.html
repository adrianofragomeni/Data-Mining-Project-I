<body>Circle of street light, rain on the windshield<br>Seeing you, for the last time<br>Eyes on the bus stop, not in the window<br>Seeing you, for the last time<br><br>My life had stood, a loaded gun<br>Cornered, til the day<br>The order passed, identified<br>And carried me away<br>Do you understand how it ends,<br>Do you understand how it ends?<br>Do you understand...how it ends, now!<br><br>Circle of darkness...<br>The rain that won't, stop!<br><br>Eyes on the bustop...<br>Do you understand how it ends now?<br>Do you understand how it ends now?<br>Do you understand, how it ends...now!
