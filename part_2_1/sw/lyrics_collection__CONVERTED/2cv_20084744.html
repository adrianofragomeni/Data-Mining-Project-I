<body>She drove her mother's car, 'twas a 2cv<br>I was most impressed by her casual dress<br>I was most impressed<br>Inside her rented room colored deepest blue<br>I suppose we found some kind of happiness<br>To fill the emptiness<br>We were simply wasting precious time<br>Hiding from the cruelest summer sky<br>She took her mother's car to get away from me<br>Heaven knows that i, I can sympathize<br>Oh I can sympathize<br>For we were never close if the truth were told<br>All we ever shared was a taste in clothes<br>Oh we were never close<br>We were simply losing everything<br>Underneath the cruelest london sun<br>We were simply wasting precious time<br>We were simply wasting precious time<br>We were simply wasting precious time
