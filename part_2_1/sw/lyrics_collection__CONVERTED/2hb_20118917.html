<body>Oh I was moved by your screen dream<br>Celluloid pictures of living<br>Your death could not kill our love for you<br>Take two people, romantic<br>Smoky nightclub situation<br>Your cigarette traces a ladder<br>Here's looking at you kid<br>Celebrate years<br>Here's looking at you kid<br>Wipe away tears<br>Long time, since we're together<br>Now I hope it's forever<br>Ideal love flies away now<br>White jacket, mmm, black tie wings too<br>You gave her away to the hero<br>Words don't express my meaning<br>Notes could not spell out the score<br>But finding not keeping's the lesson<br>Here's looking at you kid<br>Hard to forget<br>Here's looking at you kid<br>At least not yet<br>Your memory stays<br>It lingers ever<br>Will fade away never
