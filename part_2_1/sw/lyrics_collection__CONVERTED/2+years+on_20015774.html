<title>2 Years On</title>
</head>
<body>One year, two years, time goes by.<br>People laugh and people cry.<br>Every morning the clock strikes eight.<br>I go to work. <br>I close the gate.<br>And on my way, I sing a song.<br>About my wife, where I belong.<br><br>If the clouds get together and talk about the weather<br>If it's rain they anticipate<br>Baby make no mistake<br>Yes the storm will break but never me you see.<br>Two years on two years on<br>But only you can see me.<br>Only you can see me.<br><br>For what I've got<br>Sir Lancelot was just a dream and I am not<br>For I am he with something more<br>It's you and I reality.<br><br>If the cloud get together and talk about the weather<br>If it's rain they anticipate<br>Baby, make no mistake<br>Yes the storm will break but never me you see<br>Two years on two years on<br>But only you can see me<br>Only you can see me<br><br>Two years on two years on
