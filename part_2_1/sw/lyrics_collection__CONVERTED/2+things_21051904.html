<body>Found time that isn't mine<br>Stole from the world, guilty of my crime<br>How high can we both fly?<br>You answer so soft<br>That you could never be mine<br>Cuz everything's too complicated<br>But you wish we could be<br>It's wishful thinking that you will<br>Leave everything for me, <br>I know you're scared to get hurt<br>It may sound clich–π but I'm here to stay<br>For you I will do whatever it takes, yeah.<br><br>I may be a fool<br>It doesn't really matter<br>As long as I'm with you<br>I don't seem to care<br>For now I'll just sit back for awhile<br>Wait for awhile... <br><br>Things get in the way<br>2 things get in the way<br>Those damn things get in the way<br>2 things get in the way.
