<body>I sing above my vision. <br>I sing above my face.<br>A fat old amphibian speaker for the dead.<br>Gather round ye animals. <br>Gather round this lake.<br>Take upon your vigil. Wallow in the wake. <br><br>It was glorious of glories-a maple April day<br>With a pocket full of horseflies and eyes as bright as rays<br>They said walk away walk away if you can<br>but one leap out the village and our caravan began <br><br>Traveled to a forest, nestled in the sky.<br>He ran beside the buffalo-wrestled with the lions<br>Every day a saturday, a summer waking morn,<br>His skin burned golden ember due the shine that toad had born. <br><br>While riding back an eagle, laughing with the sun<br>He spied an old hairy fairy man upon the river Young.<br>And Sol said, fly away fly away if you can<br>But he settled next the oarsman, said I'm my own man and this is my life... <br><br>Heed above my meter, Heed above my fate. <br>Can't go back again...<br>I got a reason to be fevered-summer waking morn.<br>Back back when the poor poor boy was born. <br><br>Now cross into his fortune. <br>While enchanted by the queen.<br>A lone shady shelter stood beckoning his lean.<br>And in the time it takes a pillow to figure out a face.<br>Out from in the white tree she rose to take its place. <br><br>And the battle for his spirit then caused him to remain.<br>And he fought as a thousand Visigoths and he cursed the night in vain.<br>She said run away run away if you can<br>But last he heard a voice of...I'm my own man and this is my life... <br><br>Off to in her castle, laid upon the stairs<br>She showered him with daffodils and tied ribbons in his hair.<br>He woke for bare a moment but she wouldn't let him weep.<br>With lips of only roses kissed him down to sleep. <br><br>So royal loyal subjects now let your ears unbend.<br>For here ye this traveled tail must sadly meet it's end.<br>What's fate done to our hero I cannot reply...<br>The last that I saw him, a flection in her eye.
